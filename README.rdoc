== Ranked-model issue

Test case for ranked model ordering.

Steps to reproduce within seeds.rb

When calling create on a model with an attribute item_ids initially the items will be ordered correctly. However there's a secondary save that is called which incorrectly doesn't update the ordering of items where the initial value would have been 8388607.
